            Daily mood is the first "real" project i'm working on. It's a web app that will allow users
            to log their mood on a daily basis. It was important for me have a concrete project to enhance
            my learning abilities and understand how to develop an something from scratch.
        </p>
        <h3 id="mobile">
            Why mobile?
        </h3>
        <p>
            The idea behind have a web app is that it allows me learn how to code with HTML and CSS and still
            work on a project that's mobile first as nowadays every one uses smartphones.
            This project is perfect because I don't need to learn iOS or Android environment yet but i can still
            make something cool and useful.
        </p>
        <h3 id="idea">
            Where the idea comes from?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Few years ago, I decided to try something new: for one month every night i will have
            to come up with 3 things that made me happy during the day. I can be quite critical and sometimes on
            my daily life it's easy to notice only the bad things and forget about the good ones.
        </p>
        <p>
            But this was kind of linked to the idea that we HAVE TO be happy not matter what.
            The reality is that sometimes, things don't go the way we want and it's okay too. We have to
            acknowledge that as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think Daily Mood is an easy way to reflect on your day, whether it's been good or not as good as
            you expected. And it will give an overall view of how your month or year went by.
        </p>
